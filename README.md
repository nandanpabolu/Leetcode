LeetCode Solutions & Algorithm Experimentation
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, where I experiment with different algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. My goal is to refine my coding skills while solving challenging problems, and to explore how these solutions can be optimized and implemented effectively.

Repository Overview
This repository contains:

LeetCode Problem Solutions: Each folder represents a category of problems (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, etc.).
Algorithm Experiments: Experimenting with different ways to solve a problem, comparing efficiency, readability, and scalability.
Code Optimization: In some cases, I have multiple approaches to a solution, where I explore various trade-offs between time and space complexity.
Why This Repository?
This is a place where I:

Practice solving algorithmic problems.
Experiment with different algorithms to improve my understanding.
Learn to manage projects, document progress, and version control using GitHub.
How to Use
Navigate through the folders to find specific problem solutions.
Each file contains the LeetCode problem description, my approach, and detailed comments explaining the logic behind the solution.
Feel free to clone the repo and experiment with your own solutions!
Future Plans
I plan to expand this repository with:

More optimized solutions.
Experiments with advanced algorithms like Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming, and Machine Learning models.
Documentation of algorithm performance for learning purposes.
